# The Evolution of Buses
### A science fair project by Brayden Goldstein-Gelb and Henry Ayanna
Frustration with my local bus systemâ€™s constant tardiness inspired me to create a genetic algorithm to improve the efficiency of the bus routes.

## Contents
### [Explore the different bus systems with this interactive demo](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/brayden-gg/GA-bus-routes/blob/master/Demo/displayResults.html)
 - Choose either the current MBTA system or ones generated by the algorithm
 - View statistics about each bus system
 - Click on each route in a bus line to see it individually
 
 ### See the algorithm run in your browser
 - Choose the [randomly initialized version](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/brayden-gg/GA-bus-routes/blob/master/Algorithm/EfficientLines.html) or the [version that makes improvements on the existing MBTA bus system](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/brayden-gg/GA-bus-routes/blob/master/Algorithm/plugInOriginal.html)
 - Watch the algorthm iterativly make improvements over time
 - See how the various factors contribute to a "fit" bus system
 
### [Run a simplified version of the problem](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/brayden-gg/GA-bus-routes/blob/master/Algorithm/oneLine.html)
- Essentially just the travelling salesman prolem but with driving distance instead of linear distance
